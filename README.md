# Data Science Projects

Airbnb:
1. Data mining, feature analysis in R.
2. NLP named entity recognition using Python in Airbnb/bnb/NER.

Python:
1. Gram Schmidt: vectors ---> orthonormalised vectors.
2. Newton Method and damped Newton Method: method for solving non-linear optimisation problems.
3. Power Iteration method: find dominant eigenvector.
4. Graph object: Directed/undirected graph object with functions to compute topological properties of graph. Compute kernel matrix using some symmetric positive semi-definite similarity matrix (usually adjacency matrix or laplacian matrix) in kernels.py.
