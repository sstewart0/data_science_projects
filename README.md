# Data Science Projects

Airbnb:
1. Data mining, feature analysis in R
2. NLP named entity recognition using Python in Airbnb/bnb/NER

Python:
1. Algorithms:
a. Gram Schmidt: vectors -> orthonormalised vectors
b. Newton Method and damped Newton Method: method for solving non-linear optimisation problems
c. Power Iteration method: find dominant eigenvector
2. Objects:
a. Graph object: Directed/undirected graph object with functions to compute topological properties of graph.
i. Kernels: Compute kernel matrix using some symmetric positive semi-definite similarity matrix (usually adjacency matrix or laplacian matrix)
