Gram Schmidt: vectors -> orthonormalised vectors.

Newton Method and damped Newton Method: method for solving non-linear optimisation problems.

Power Iteration method: find dominant eigenvector.

Graph_models: 
1. Directed/undirected graph object with functions to compute topological properties of graph in graph.py. 
2. Compute kernel matrix; calculate mean, variance, etc of points in the feature space using the kernel matrix.
3. Simulate a Barabasi-Albert scale-free random graph model in BA_Model.py.

Itemset_mining:
1. Perform apriori & fpgrowth frequent pattern mining algorithms (for transaction data) & compute all (viable) association rules.

Iris_data:
1. Pairwise similarities between data points calculated using a radial-basis-function kernel which are used as the weights for edges between nodes
in graphing the data. (networkx, plotly)
