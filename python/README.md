Gram Schmidt: vectors -> orthonormalised vectors.

Newton Method and damped Newton Method: method for solving non-linear optimisation problems.

Power Iteration method: find dominant eigenvector.

Graph_models: 
1. Directed/undirected graph object with functions to compute topological properties of graph in graph.py. 
2. Compute kernel matrix; calculate mean, variance, etc of points in the feature space using the kernel matrix.
3. Simulate a Barabasi-Albert scale-free random graph model in BA_Model.py.

Itemset_mining:
1. Perform apriori & fpgrowth frequent pattern mining algorithms (for transaction data) & compute all (viable) association rules.

Iris_data:
1. Pairwise similarities between data points calculated using a radial-basis-function kernel which are used as the weights for edges between nodes
in graphing the data. (networkx, plotly)

Tweets:
1. Perform sentiment analysis on tweets

Dashboard:
1. Create an interactive dashboard using dash & plotly in python of Airbnb data in NYC

Spotify:
1. Downloaded personal streaming history from spotify.
2. Created functions to scrape relevant information from websites for dashboard creation.
3. In the process of implementing an interactive dashboard to display data on top artists, genres, songs, etc.

PL:
1. Created functions to mine premier league player statistics and create the most extensive dataset on all players available.

Crashes:
1. Created a connection to the SQLite Database which contains over 36 million entries & 110 feature variables, merged the ‘collisions’ and ‘parties’ databases & cleaned the vehicle make attribute for consistency. 
2. Using Bayesian Statistics, statistical tests and visualisation methods I analysed the impact of vehicle make, weather conditions, etc on the severity of the motorbike crashes. 
3. Predicted crash fatalities using a random forest classifier with 70% recall & accuracy by feature engineering and resampling to balance binary classes for model training.

Fuzzy_Strings:
1. Using phonetic algorithms to match fuzzy strings
